# Glyph Magic in Minecraft!

A recreation of Luz Noceda's glyph magic from The Owl House in Denizen!

### How to setup for your own server

##### Step 1

Make sure that you have the plugin [Denizen](https://denizenscript.com) running on your server, as this is what runs and interprets the code.

##### Step 2

Next, you need to drag the DenizenScript source files (ones ending in `.dsc`) into the `plugins/Denizen/scripts` directory.

##### Step 3

Take the schematic in the `schematics` folder and drag it into `plugins/Denizen/schematics`. If it is not there, then make it!

##### Step 4

Now you need to reload Denizen. To do this go onto the console or be in-game as an operator and issue the command:

```
/ex reload
```

and it will reload all the scripts, allowing you to start having fun and messing around with the glyph magic!
